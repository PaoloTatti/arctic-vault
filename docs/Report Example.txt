 Based on the information provided, we can create the following Data Vault model:

1. Hubs:
   - Customers_Hub (CustomerID, LoadDate)
   - Orders_Hub (OrderID, LoadDate)
   - Products_Hub (ProductID, LoadDate)

2. Links:
   - Customers_Orders_Link (CustomerID, OrderID, LoadDate)
   - Orders_Products_Link (OrderID, ProductID, LoadDate)

3. Satellites:
   - Products_Satellite (ProductID, ProductName, Category, ListPrice, LoadDate)
   - Customers_Satellite (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, PhoneNumber, LoadDate)
   - Orders_Satellite (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, LoadDate)
   - OrderDetails_Satellite (OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, UnitPrice, LoadDate)


In this model:
- The Hub tables contain the business keys and metadata for each entity. The primary key for each Hub table is the respective business key (e.g., CustomerID for Customers_Hub). The metadata column is the LoadDate which records when the data was first loaded into the system.
- The Link tables connect the Hubs and represent the relationships between entities. The primary keys for the Link tables are a combination of the foreign keys from the connected Hubs (e.g., CustomerID and OrderID for Customers_Orders_Link). The metadata column is the LoadDate which records when the relationship was first established.
- The Satellite tables store additional attributes about their parent Hub or Link. The primary key for each Satellite table is a combination of its parent's primary key and the metadata column LoadDate. This allows us to track changes in attributes over time.
