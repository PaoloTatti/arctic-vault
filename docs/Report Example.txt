 
Based on the conversation, the following Data Vault model can be created:

1. Hubs:
   - Customers (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, PhoneNumber)
   - OrderDetails (OrderID, ProductID)
   - Orders (OrderID, CustomerID)
   - Products (ProductID, ProductName, Category, ListPrice)
   
2. Links:
   - Customers_Orders (CustomerID, OrderID)
   - Orders_OrderDetails (OrderID, ProductID)
   
3. Satellites:
   - Customers_Satellite (CustomerID, LoadDate, RecordSource)
   - OrderDetails_Satellite (OrderID, LoadDate, RecordSource)
   - Orders_Satellite (OrderID, LoadDate, RecordSource)
   - Products_Satellite (ProductID, LoadDate, RecordSource)
   
In this Data Vault model, the Hubs represent the main entities of interest to the business. The Links connect the Hubs and record the relationships between them. Finally, the Satellites provide additional information about the parent Hub or Link and include metadata about when the data was loaded and from where.
